# Image-Caption-Generator

Implemented an Image-Caption-Generator model using Python and TensorFlow. The code includes the data preprocessing pipeline, the model architecture, and the training and evaluation scripts. The trained model can be used to generate captions for new images, and the code is open-source and available for others to use and contribute to.
